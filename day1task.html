<h1>OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT</H1>
<P><h2>1)Objects:</h2>
<br>
The following code assigns a simple value (Mercedes) to a variable named car:
<br>
var car = "Mercedes";<br>
<br>
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
<br>
The following code assigns many values (Mercedes, C-class, White and so on) to a variable named Car:
<br>
var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: “850kg”, Mileage: “8Kmpl”, Rating: 4.5};
<br>
<br>
The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
<br>
Syntax:
<br>
<br>
var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};
<br>
<br>
So, conclusion and definition for JS objects is “JavaScript objects are containers for named values”.
<br>
<br>
<h2>2)Object Properties</h2>
<br>
The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.
<br>
var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: “850kg”,Mileage: “8Kmpl”, Rating: 4.5};
<br>
<br>
From the above snippet, let’s have a look what falls under property and property value:

The object properties can be different primitive values, other objects and functions.

Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.
<br>
The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
<br>
ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;
<br>
<br>
The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:
<br>
<br>
delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;
<br>
<br>
The syntax to access a property from an object is:
<br>
<br>
objectName.property        // Car.Make
<br>
<br>           //or
<br>
objectName["property”]    // Car["Make"]

<br>          //or

<br>
objectName[expression]   // x = "Make"; Car[x]
<br>
<br>
So, Conclusion and simple definition for Java Script properties is “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”.
<br>
<br>
<h2>3)Object Methods</h2>
<br>
Object Methods
Objects can also have methods.

Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.<br>

Property-------	Property Value<br>
firstName------	John<br>
lastName-------	Doe
<br>
age------------	50
<br>
eyeColor-------	blue
<br>
fullName-------	function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}
<br>
<br>
A method is a function stored as a property.
<br>
<br>
Example
const person = {
  firstName: "John",<br>
  lastName : "Doe",<br>
  id       : 5566,<br>
  fullName : function() {<br>
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;<br>
  }<br>
};<br>
<br>
In the example above, this refers to the person object.

I.E. this.firstName means the firstName property of this.

I.E. this.firstName means the firstName property of person.
