<h1>OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT</H1>
<P>Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.

Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.

</P>
<br>
<p>Object Definition
<br>
You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:
<br>
Example
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
</p>
<br>
<p>
Object Properties
<br>
The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:
<br>
Property-------	Property Value<br>
firstName------	John<br>
lastName-------	Doe<br>
age------------ 50<br>
eyeColor-------	blue<br>
<br>
Accessing Object Properties
<br>
You can access object properties in two ways:
<br>
objectName.propertyName<br>
or

objectName["propertyName"]<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Object Methods
<br>
Objects can also have methods.

Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.
